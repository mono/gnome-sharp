The Gtk#/Gnome# website can be found at: http://gtk-sharp.sourceforge.net/

Gnome# is a .NET language binding for assorted GNOME libraries.  Gnome# is 
free software, licensed under the GNU LGPL.

Building & Installing Gnome#:
---------------------------

    The build uses bootstrap instead of the traditional configure:

        ./bootstrap-<version>
        make
        make install

    You may want to consider using configure's prefix option to install
    Gnome# using the same prefix as Mono.  That way all of your .NET assemblies
    get placed in the same place, and you don't need to do any extra "configuring"
    to make it so mono can find your assemblies.  In other words,
    doing something like:

        ./bootstrap-<version> --prefix=/the/path/that/was/used/for/mono
        make
        make install

    (Of course, replace "/the/path/that/was/used/for/mono" with whatever path
    which was used for Mono.  This might have been "/usr", "/usr/local", or
    something similar.)

--------

    For those who wish to help with the development of Gnome#, they should
    read the file named: HACKING.

    Also, anyone wishing to hack Gnome# is encouraged to join the Gtk#
    mailing list.  And to visit the #mono IRC channel (on irc.gnome.org).
